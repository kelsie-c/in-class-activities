# Create a PWA

For this activity you are going to convert the Trip Planner website into a PWA.

## Instructions

* Refer back to the activities we previously worked through to help you accomplish the following steps.

  * Link the app manifest to the website - the `manifest.webamanifest` file has been created for you.

  * Install the service worker to cache static assets - the service worker has been registered for you.

  * Retrieve cached files for an offline experience.

  * Download the PWA.

## BONUS

* Can we use the Cache Storage in the browser to store dynamic requests from the user, for example from a web form? If not, then what can we use?

Use Google or another search engine to research the preceding topic.
