# Custom Methods

## Instructions

* Open `userModel.js` and create the following custom methods.

  * `setFullName`: sets the current user's `fullName` property to their lastName appended to their `firstName`

  * `lastUpdatedDate`: sets the current user's `lastUpdated` property to `Date.now()`

* When you are finished use your new custom methods in a `POST` request.

## ðŸ’¡ Hint(s)

* Use the [Mongoose docs on schema instance methods](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#methods) if you are stuck.
