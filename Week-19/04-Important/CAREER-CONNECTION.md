Woot woot! You finally made it to React! Hopefully it will be everything you dreamed it is. Many students consider React this magical fantasy land that will do everything much more easily, and will create the most amazing applications&mdash;and it does, once you've gotten over that steep learning curve.

In many ways, it can feel like you're restarting front-end development all over again. This time, everything is ES6 JavaScript syntax and classes, JSX, CSS as a JavaScript object. It's a whole new world... and one we couldn't possibly give you everything all in just a couple of weeks.

But did you know that React is not the only front-end JavaScript framework/library? It isn't. There are several other very popular options that we'll introduce you to as part of this Career Connection.

> **Nerd Note:** There is an ongoing discussion in the development world about what constitutes a framework versus a library. Sometimes you'll hear these terms interchangeably, but they're not really interchangeable. FreeCodeCamp has a great article that'll give you a primer on the difference: [The Difference Between a Framework and a Library](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library-bd133054023f/)

### Looking to the Future

#### Front-end Frameworks & The Interview

With any luck, you'll walk into an interview where their technology stack includes React. At least, if that's what you want. But you also might walk into an interview where their technology stack does include a front-end framework you'll have to work with, but it's not React. So it's a good idea to have a little cursory knowledge about the biggest and most important frameworks out there.

In the 2019 [StackOverflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019), React.js was the most popular front-end JavaScript library/framework, coming in as being used by 31.3% of respondents. However, Angular was not far behind with 30.7%, and next on the list came Vue.js at 15.2%.

> **Note**: jQuery was actually _the_ most popular at 48.7%, but would not be considered a comparison to React/Angular/Vue, and is likely still just in use by a wide range of legacy applications.

Here's the thing. You are learning React, but the concepts and skills you learn here are directly transferable to Angular or Vue. So if you're looking at positions that call for Angular or Vue skillsets, go ahead and apply anyway! Your React development experience is completely and utterly relevant!

### Technical Interview Preparation

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. We strongly recommend that you practice these. Doing so will prepare you to handle some of the most common questions in an interview or promotion discussion.

Please refer to the class repository to find these algorithms:

- Coding Algorithm #1: Maximum Continuous Subarray

- Coding Algorithm #2: Merge Meetings Times

- Coding Algorithm #3: Int To Roman

For practice in a live, interview-style IDE, complete the following algorithm challenge. The solution will be discussed in the weekly recommended session.

Once you start, you'll have seven days to complete it. After the seven days has elapsed, the challenge will close.

- CodeSignal Algorithm: [Missing Number](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/xttcwYyLzN9udSHRm/oEiyqtuFgGaFLj)
